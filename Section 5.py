# Section 5 Type casting
# This converts a variable in which case is a number into a string same thing can be done vice-versa and with booleans
x = 1  # Integer(Number)
y = 2.3  # Float (Decimal Number)
z = "9"  # String (Words)
y = str(y)
z = str(z)
x = str(x)
print("X is " + x)
print("X is " + y)
print(z * 3)
